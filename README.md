Are you tired of staring at a blank cursor? Do you suffer from chronic *Analysis Paralysis*? Do you spend more time planning your code than actually writing it?

**Dr. DevLove** (alias `gh-stats`) is your prescription. It's a CLI tool that proves you *are* getting work done. It validates your existence by tracking your daily code contributions across the GitHub universe, bypassing the need for local clones because who has disk space for that?

## 💊 The Prescription (Features)

*   **Remote Diagnostics**: Scans your GitHub activity directly via API. No local repositories required.
*   **Vital Signs**: Beautiful, colored terminal output with progress bars that spin faster than your imposter syndrome.
*   **Scalable Treatment**: Works for personal projects and massive organizations alike.
*   **Time Travel**: Check your stats for `today`, `this week`, `this month`, or `this year`.
*   **Evidence Collection**: Export all commit messages to a Markdown file for AI analysis or boss-pleasing reports.
*   **Triage Mode**: Automatically sorts repositories by last push date, so you see your most recent "saves" first.

poetry run gh-stats --range lastweek --export-commits

# Export full commit messages (with body) to a custom file
poetry run gh-stats --range lastweek --export-commits --full-message --output weekly_report

# Stalk the legends - See another user's public repo activity
poetry run gh-stats --user torvalds --range thismonth

# See a teammate's contributions in your shared org
poetry run gh-stats --user colleague --orgs YOUR_COMPANY_ORG --range lastweek

# The "I'm a 10x Engineer" view (Non-personal repos only, top 10)
poetry run gh-stats --range year --no-personal --org-limit 10
```

### Parameters

| Flag | Effect | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--user` | Target GitHub username (view others' public repos, or combine with --orgs for teammates) | Authenticated user |
| `--range` | Date shorthand (e.g. `today`, `3days`, `week`) | None |
| `--date-after` / `--date-before` | Check window (YYYYMMDD, now-1week) | - |
| `--since` / `--until` | Alias for above | - |
| `--orgs` | Comma-separated organization names | None |
| `--no-personal` | Exclude personal repositories | - |
| `--personal-limit` | Max personal repos to scan | Automatic (based on range) |
| `--org-limit` | Max repos per organization to scan | Automatic (based on range) |
| `--all-branches` | Enable scanning of all active branches | False (default branch only) |
| `--export-commits` | Export commit messages to a Markdown file | False |
| `--full-message` | Include full commit body in export (default: title only) | False |
| `--output` / `-o` | Specify output filename (defaults to `reports/` directory) | Auto-generated |
| `--org-users` | Team mode: compare all contributors in specified org(s) | False |
| `--highlights` | Show insights (longest streak, most productive day, etc.) | False |
| `--group-by` | Group export by `user` or `repo` (for `--org-users`) | `user` |

### 📅 Advanced Usage

**1. Flexible Date Ranges (yt-dlp style)**
Supports natural language and concise formats:
- `--range 3days` (last 3 days)
- `--date-after 20240101` (YYYYMMDD)
- `--date-before now-2weeks` (relative)

**2. 🌿 Multi-Branch Scanning**
By default, the tool only counts commits on the default branch (usually `main`).
If you are working on multiple feature branches in parallel, use `--all-branches` to capture all your recent activity across these branches.
This works by intelligently analyzing your GitHub Events stream.

```bash
gh-stats --range 3days --all-branches
```

**3. 📝 AI-Ready Export**
Need a weekly summary? Use `--export-commits` to generate a Markdown file containing every commit message from the period, grouped by project. Perfect for feeding into an LLM to generate professional progress reports.

```bash
gh-stats --range lastweek --export-commits
```

**4. 👥 View Teammate Contributions**
Use `--user` with `--orgs` to view a colleague's contributions in your shared organization. The tool scans org repos you have access to and filters for the target user's commits.

```bash
# View colleague alice's contributions in YOUR_COMPANY_ORG
poetry run gh-stats --user alice --orgs YOUR_COMPANY_ORG --range lastweek --export-commits
```

**Note**: When org repos exceed 64, you'll be prompted to scan all or enter a limit (repos are sorted by most recently updated).

**5. 📁 Export File Management**
- All exports are saved to the `reports/` directory by default
- Use `--output` to specify a custom filename
- Duplicate filenames get auto-incremented, never overwritten

```bash
# Export with custom filename
poetry run gh-stats --range lastweek --export-commits --output my_weekly_report
# Output: reports/my_weekly_report.md
```

**6. 🏆 Personal Highlights**
Use `--highlights` to see insights about your coding patterns, including your longest streak, most productive day, and favorite weekday.

```bash
poetry run gh-stats --range month --highlights
```

**7. 👥 Team Mode (Org-wide Comparison)**
Use `--org-users` to compare all contributors in an organization. This scans all repos in the org and aggregates stats per contributor.

```bash
# Compare all contributors in YOUR_COMPANY_ORG this month
poetry run gh-stats --orgs YOUR_COMPANY_ORG --org-users --range thismonth

# Export team stats grouped by repo instead of user
poetry run gh-stats --orgs YOUR_COMPANY_ORG --org-users --range lastweek --output team_report --group-by repo
```
